All of these documents will run on Jupyter Notebook. For easy cross platform accessibility and commonality, we strongly suggest that you download and install Anaconda [https://anaconda.com/] on your system. This gives us a common environment to operate and a common set of libraries (the most popular) to begin working from together.
